  A geoggraphic data science, reproducible<br/>teaching resource in R
---

**ANNOUNCMENT**: This is a **revised version** of granolarr, **currently under development** to meet the University of Leicester ["Ingite"](https://le.ac.uk/ignite) approach to blended learning for the academic year 2020/2021. The first version of granolarr is still available at [granolarr_v1](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr_v1/).

The materials included in **granolarr** have been designed for a module focusing on the programming language R as an effective tool for data science. R is one of the most widely used programming languages, and it provides access to a vast repository of programming libraries, which cover all aspects of data science from data wrangling to statistical analysis, from machine learning to data visualisation. That includes a variety of libraries for processing spatial data, perform geographic information analysis, and create maps. As such, R is an extremely versatile, free and opensource tool in geographic information science, which combines the capabilities of traditional GIS software with the advantages of a scripting language, and an interface to a vast array of algorithms.

The materials aim to cover the necessary skills in basic programming, data wrangling and reproducible research to tackle sophisticated but non-spatial data analyses. The first part of the module will focus on core programming techniques, data wrangling and practices for reproducible research. The second part of the module will focus on non-spatial data analysis approaches, including statistical analysis and machine learning.

## Reproducibility

You can now reproduce granolarr using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Once Docker is installed on your system, you can build the sdesabbata/granolarr image running the `Docker_Build.sh` or [download the latest sdesabbata/granolarr image from the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sdesabbata/granolarr). You can then [clone this repository from GitHub](https://github.com/sdesabbata/granolarr) to your system and run the script `Docker_Make.sh` from the repository folder. The script will instantiate a Docker container for the sdesabbata/granolarr image, bind mount the repository folder to the container and execute `Make.R` on the container, clearing and re-making all the materials.

For instance, in a unix-based system like Linux or Mac OS, you can reproduce granolarr using the following four commands:

```{bash}
docker pull sdesabbata/granolarr:latest
git clone https://github.com/sdesabbata/granolarr.git
cd granolarr
./Docker_Make.sh
```

This approach should allow you to not simply use the materials as they are, but to easily edit and create your own version in the same computational environment.
