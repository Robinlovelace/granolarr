This repository contains reproducible materials to teach geographic information and data science in R. Part of the materials are derived from the lectures and practical sessions for the module [GY7702 Practical Programming in R](https://sdesabbata.github.io/GY7702/) of the [MSc in Geographic Information Science](https://le.ac.uk/courses/geographical-information-science-msc/2019) at the [School of Geography, Geology, and the Environment](https://le.ac.uk/gge) of the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/), by [Dr Stefano De Sabbata](https://stefanodesabbata.com/).
