This document is an small example of a reproducible analysis. This is an [R Markdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) script created in RStudio, which uses [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) libraries, a dataset containing the UK Census variables a used to create the [2011 Output Area Classification](https://github.com/geogale/2011OAC) for the city of Leicester and its output, and a dataset of the [Indexes of Multiple Deprivation 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015) for the city of Leicester. The analysis is compiled to a *pdf* document.



## Libraries

Load the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) libraries.

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```



## Session info

In reproducible analysis, it is good practice to include the `sessionInfo`, which provides all the information about the system and libraries used to create and compile the document.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```



# Data

**Important:** If you haven't done so yet, please clone the repository for this module, as described in the first practical. The code below assumes that you have cloned the repository for this module in the `Repos` folder. Alternatively, you can download the file from the module repository on GitHub or Blackboard, save it in a folder of your preference, and change the file path accordingly.

The [2011 Output Area Classification](https://github.com/geogale/2011OAC) (2011 OAC) is a geodemographic classification of the census Output Areas (OA) of the UK, which was created by [Gale et al. (2016)](http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/232) starting from an initial set of 167 prospective variables from the United Kingdom Census 2011: 86 were removed, 41 were retained as they are, and 40 were combined, leading to a final set of 60 variables. [Gale et al. (2016)](http://josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/232) finally used the k-means clustering approach to create 8 clusters or supergroups (see [map at datashine.org.uk](https://oac.datashine.org.uk)), as well as 26 groups and 76 subgroups. The dataset in the file `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv` contains all the original 167 variables, as well as the resulting groups, for the city of Leicester. The full variable names can be found in the file `2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Lookup.csv`.

The [Indexes of Multiple Deprivation 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2015) (http://dclgapps.communities.gov.uk/imd/idmap.html) (see [map at cdrc.ac.uk](https://maps.cdrc.ac.uk/#/geodemographics/imde2015))are based on a series of variables across seven distinct domains of deprivation which are combined to calculate the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 (IMD 2015). This is an overall measure of multiple deprivation experienced by people living in an area. These indexes are calculated for every Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA), which a larger geographic unit than the OAs used for the 2011 OAC. The dataset in the file `IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv` contains the main Index of Multiple Deprivation, as well as the values for the seven distinct domains of deprivation, and two additional indexes regarding deprivation affecting children and older people. The dataset includes scores, ranks (where 1 indicates the most deprived area), and decile (i.e., the first decile includes the 10% most deprived areas in England). 


```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load 2011 Output Area Classification data
leicester_2011OAC <- read_csv("~/Repos/GY7702/Data/2011_OAC_Raw_uVariables_Leicester.csv")

# Load Indexes of Multiple deprivation data
leicester_IMD2015 <- read_csv("~/Repos/GY7702/Data/IndexesMultipleDeprivation2015_Leicester.csv")
```



# A simple analysis

The analysis below uses *dplyr*, which is another useful library that is part of the Tidyverse. The functions provided by *dplyr* are frequently used in scripts that employ a [pipe-based programming](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html) style. This is not covered in this lecture, but *Gather_Ofcom_data_2012.R* provides an example of that approach. The chunk of code below loads the *dyplr* library.

The function *count* of the *dplyr* library can be used to count the number rows of a *data.frame*, grouped by a variable (in the example below, the local authority district). As you can see, the code below is formatted in a way similar to a code block, although it is not a code block. This is very common in R programming (especially when functions have a lot of parameters) as it makes the code more readable.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_2011OAC %>%
  count(supgrpname)
```

The function *summarise* of the same library *dplyr* can be used in combination with the function *group_by* to summarise the values of the rows of a *data.frame*. Rows can be grouped by a variable (in the example below, whether an area is urban or rural), and then aggregated based on a function over one or more columns. In this example  the function is *mean*, over the column *Accident_Severity* (where numeric values range from 1, for the most sever, to 3, for the less sever accidents).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Group accidents by Urban and Rural areas
leicester_2011OAC %>%
  group_by(supgrpname) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Population = sum(Total_Population),
    Total_Households = sum(Total_Households)
  )
```



# Re-shaping 

The IMD 2015 data are in a *long* format, which means that every area is represented by more than one row: the column `Value` presents the value; the column `IndicesOfDeprivation` indicates which index the value refers to; the column `Measurement` indicates whether the value is a score, rank, or decile. The code below illustrate the data format for the LSOA including the University of Leicester (feture code `E01013649`).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  filter(FeatureCode == "E01013649") %>%
  select(FeatureCode, IndicesOfDeprivation, Measurement, Value)
```

In the following section, the analysis aims to explore how certain census variables vary in areas with different deprivation levels. Thus, we need to extract the `Decile` rows from the IMD 2015 dataset and transform the data in a *wide* format, where each index is represented as a separate column. To that purpose, we also need to change the name of the indexes slightly, to exlude spaces and puncutuation, so that the new column names are simplier.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide <- leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  # Select only Socres
  filter(Measurement == "Decile") %>%
  # Trim names of IndicesOfDeprivation
  mutate(IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\s", "")) %>%
  mutate(IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "[:punct:]", "")) %>%
  mutate(IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\(", "")) %>%
  mutate(IndicesOfDeprivation = str_replace_all(IndicesOfDeprivation, "\\)", "")) %>%
  # Spread
  spread(
    key = IndicesOfDeprivation,
    value = Value
  ) %>%
  # Drop columns
  select(-DateCode, -Measurement, -Units)
```

Let's compare the columns of the original *long* IMD 2015 dataset with the *wide* dataset created above.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
colnames(leicester_IMD2015)
colnames(leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide)
```

Thus, we now have only one row representing the LSOA including the University of Leicester (feture code `E01013649`) and the main Index of Multiple deprivation is now represented by the column `IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD`. The value reported is the same -- that is 5, which means that that LSOA is estimated to be in the range 40-50% most deprived areas in England -- but we changed the data format.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Original long IMD 2015 dataset
leicester_IMD2015 %>%
  filter(
    FeatureCode == "E01013649",
    IndicesOfDeprivation == "Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)",
    Measurement == "Decile"
  ) %>%
  select(FeatureCode, IndicesOfDeprivation, Measurement, Value)

# New wide IMD 2015 dataset
leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide %>%
  filter(FeatureCode == "E01013649") %>%
  select(FeatureCode, IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD)
```

# Join datasets

As mentioned in previous lectures, two tables can be joined using a common column of identifiers. We can thus load a second dataset, containing the information about the vehicles involved in the accidents. In this case, one or more vehicles will be involved for each accidents.

The two tables can be merged using the function *merge*, and specify the common column (or columns, if more than one is to be used as identifier) as argument of *by*.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 <- leicester_2011OAC %>%
  left_join(leicester_IMD2015_decile_wide, by = c("LSOA11CD" = "FeatureCode"))
```

The average and standard deviation age of the vehicles involved in an accident per accident severity can then be calculated using the code below. Note how the second aggregation function *sd* (standard deviation) is added after the first aggregation function, to create a second column of aggregated values.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Group and average severity per Urban and Rural areas
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 %>%
  count(supgrpname, IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Group and average severity per Urban and Rural areas
leicester_2011OAC_IMD2015 %>%
  group_by(IndexofMultipleDeprivationIMD) %>%
  summarise(
    adults_not_empl_perc = sum(u074 + u075) / sum(Total_Population)
  )
```


# Exercise

Add another section of R code below, that creates a new column for the *accidents* dataset, which represents the hour of the accident -- e.g., from *18:45* to *18*. That can be achieved using the function *substr* (to select a section of a character variable, see *?substr*) on the column *Time* and the converting the result *as.numeric*.

Once the first part above is completed, calculate the number of accidents per hour of the day in which the accident happened, and then the average severity per hour of the day. Then, merge the *accidents* and *vehicles* again, and calculate the average age of the driver per hour of the day.

Solutions are provided in the script *Reproducible_analysis_Exercise_solution.R* in the *Analysis* folder.
